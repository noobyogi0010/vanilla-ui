# Vanilla UI ðŸ’«

**Vanilla UI** is a simple repo created and maintained by me to build vanilla and accessible implementations of all the amazing UI components out there.

## Motivation ðŸ˜®

The zeal to understand the depths of Javascript, CSS and HTML led me to develop this repo. The basic idea was to sharpen and deepen my knowledge of these languages. And what other way is there to do so than getting your hands dirty with them.

## What to expect? ðŸ¤”

You can find bare JS, HTML and CSS code for all the basic as well as some advanced UI components like Pop-up Model, Accordin, Image Carousel, and many others.

All these components will be as accessible as possibly I can develop them.

## Usage ðŸ§©

Just clone the repo and start looking at the codes for each component one by one from their respective sub-directories.

## Contribution ðŸ’ª

There are two ways in which you can contribute:

- Post an issue that you find in any of the components.
- Post an issue to request for a specific component that you want to be included in this repo.

See the contribution guide [here](#).
