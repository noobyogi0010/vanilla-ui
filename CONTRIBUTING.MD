### Thank you for showing interest in contributing to Vanilla JS ðŸ¥°, you are awesome!

Here's is a simple guide to get you started with contributing.

## Setup the Project

The steps are pretty straight forward:

1. Fork the repo (click on the `Fork` button at top right).

2. Clone the forked repo locally using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/vanilla-ui.git
   ```

3. Now move inside the new clonned repo by running the following command from you favourite command line tool:

   ```
   cd ./vanilla-ui
   ```

4. Finally start exploring the codebase, and if you want to run any file then just open the `.html` file using your favourite browser.
